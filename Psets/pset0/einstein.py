"""In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms)
and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.

# prompt the user for a mass as an integer
m = int(input("Mass: "))
# output the equivalent number of joules as an integer
c = 300000000

print(e)

# I couldn't find a way to convert it to joules yet

# i found a solution from a website but all i needed to do was to convert everything into joule

# other than that.....
#You know what i was actually too close. Ä±'ll do better next time
